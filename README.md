# lost-woods
An academic pursuit to find the very worst data structure in existence. 

The lost woods is a data structure with linked nodes called trees (this is mostly just to maintain the forest metaphor).

Each tree holds a pointer to one or more other trees in the forest. From the structure, you can follow these paths which
moves a cursor from one tree to another.

Every time you move this cursor, the paths between the trees gets shuffled around.


Send me a message if you happen to find any bugs/insecurity/loopholes etc.
